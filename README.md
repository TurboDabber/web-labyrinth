Maze Solver with Dijkstra's Algorithm and Recursive Backtracking
This project is a maze-solving application that integrates an Angular front-end with a C# back-end. The front-end visualizes the labyrinth (maze), and the back-end contains the algorithms for solving the maze using Dijkstra's Algorithm (for shortest path) and Recursive Backtracking (for finding a valid path). The user interacts with the maze through the Angular interface, which then communicates with the C# API to process and solve the maze.
